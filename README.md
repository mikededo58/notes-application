# notes-application

A project to assist me with taking notes

##

This application is use to make notes and show them in the UI. For this project I used Express to route requests, connect to a DB and show the information entered. It was great to apply modulized routing as well as use tools such as insomnia to test my routes. Some of the challenges were determining proper file strucutre, and how best to leverage routes.
